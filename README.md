# pongML
A deep-learning program that teaches itself how to play Pong. Will create images of the graphs showing the trends of the program when the program finishes (i.e. when the user chooses to or when the program has reached its maximum number of generations)

The image below shows the graphs using a maximum score of 10 and maximum generation count of 1000:
